# :newspaper: NY Times ReactJS App
A `ReactJS`/`NodeJS`/`Express`/ `MongoDB` application where users can query, display, and save articles from the [New York Times Article Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/). Users can also delete saved articles.

You can view the deployed version [here](https://react-mongo-demo.herokuapp.com/)!


## Functionality
On the backend, the app uses `express` to serve routes and `mongoose` to interact with a `MongoDB` database.

On the frontend, the app uses `ReactJS` for rendering components, `axios` for internal/external API calls, and `bootstrap` as a styling framework.
